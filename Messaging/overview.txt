The messaging system may seem complex and confusing at first. It sort of is. Below is an outline of how it works.



1. Some component in SpringBoard sends some form of an update to RAMessagingServer
	RAMessagingServer -> send CFNotification to app to retrieve updated info[1]
	|       |
	|       |
	|	    |
	|       |-------------------> app receives CFNotification
	|                             - app send CPDistributedMessagingCenter message to sendMessageAndReceiveReplyName:
	|                               |-------> SpringBoard sends data, callback is called with a success
	|-----> timeout (4s)
			- callback, failed
			- notify user





[1] - tries to send immediately, unless the app isn't running
